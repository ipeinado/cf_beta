  long_product_description: Balsamiq is the maker of Mockups, the rapid wireframing software that combines the simplicity of paper sketching with the power of a digital tool so that teams can focus on what's important. We're a fast-growing, but small and personable company that competes on usability and service. We believe work should be fun, and that life is too short for bad software.
